# Contribution-to-github
Steps to contribute in anyone's repository

-Go to the repository on github. (Say it’s by myfriend, and is called the_repo, then you’ll find it at https://github.com/myfriend/the_repo.)
-Click the `Fork` button at the top right.
-You’ll now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.
