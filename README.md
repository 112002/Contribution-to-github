# Contribution-to-github
Steps to contribute in anyone's repository

- Go to the repository on github. (Say it’s by myfriend, and is called the_repo, then you’ll find it at https://github.com/myfriend/the_repo.) <br />
- Click the `Fork` button at the top right.
- You’ll now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.
- Open a terminal/shell.(I personally prefer Gitbash).
- Type
````
$ git clone git@github.com:username/the_repo
`````
       <br /> where username is your username.
- You’ll now have a local copy of your version of that repository.
- Change into that project directory (the_repo):
`````
$ cd the_repo ````
